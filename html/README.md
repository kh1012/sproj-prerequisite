To start the HTML example, you can set your PC environment up in the following steps.
<br /><br />

## Tools Download and Installing
  Introduce the basic Tool of the Seed Project.
  All descriptions work in the above Tool; however, you can use others. 
  
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) :computer:
  Download VSCode and install.  
  Install IDE for scripting and editing the code.  
  `It is fine to use notepad instead of VSCode.` 
  <br />
    
- [Chrome](https://www.google.co.kr/intl/ko/chrome/) :earth_africa:
  Download Chrome browser and install.  
  Install the browser for testing scripted code.
  `It is OK to use Edge, Firefox, and etc.`
